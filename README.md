## Overview

If you're like me, then you might also find analyzing your Spotify listening activity very interesting. However, you might also find that this information is hard to access and filter by your own preferences of what you want to see. With Splotify, users will be able to visualize Spotify data such as:

- favorite artists/songs/genres
- listening time/stats (i.e. danceability, energy, acousticness)

in various different forms such as graphs, pie charts, and images.
